# Turbulent Egg Carton Predictions with Deep Learning

An introduction to python and deep learning for wall shear stress prediction.
Jupyter notebook example has been included.

We will be creating a simple U-Unet using the
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) library.

## Python Virtual Environment

We can create a python [virtual
environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) by typing the following
commands in the terminal

```powershell
python -m venv _env
```

In visual studio code this can be done using

```powershell
py -m venv _env
```

## Installing The Requirements

To install the requirements

```powershell
pythom -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
